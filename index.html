    <h1>Working Heatmaps:</h1>
    <p>In October of last year, I quit my job as an ESL teacher. Since then I have spent my time on other projects, mostly
        writing and coding in order to try and find a job I enjoy more. Below is a heatmap showing what I have been doing 
        every day in order to reach this goal.
    </p>
    <h3>Writing Heatmap (words/day):</h3>
    <div id='container'>
        
    </div>
    <h3>Gym (classes/week):</h3>
    <div id="gym"></div>
    <h3>Create Your Own:</h3>
    <p>Enter a datapoint to add to the chart. The X-Axis will label the top of your chart, the Y-Axis will label the 
        left-hand side of your chart, and the Heat will determine the colour of your chart.</p>
        <p>Add as many data points as you want!:</p>
    <form id='point-adder'>
        <label>X-Axis:</label>
        <input type="text" name="xaxis">
        <label>Y-Axis:</label>
        <input type="text" name="yaxis">
        <label>Heat:</label>
        <input type="number" name="heatnumber">
        <button type='submit'>Submit</button>
    </form>
    <div id="new-data-points"></div>
    <p>When you have entered all the data points you want, click 'Create Chart' do display them on your own heatmap below!</p>
