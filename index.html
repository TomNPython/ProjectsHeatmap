    <h1>Working Heatmaps:</h1>
    <p>In October of last year, I quit my job as an ESL teacher. Since then I have spent my time on other projects, mostly
        writing and coding in order to try and find a job I enjoy more. Below is a heatmap showing what I have been doing 
        every day in order to reach this goal.
